const POC_CRITERIA = {
  performance: {
    renderTime: '<16ms',
    memoryUsage: '<50MB',
    bundleSize: '<20KB'
  },
  developerExperience: {
    learningCurve: 'measure time to productivity',
    debugging: 'tool support evaluation',
    testing: 'ease of unit testing'
  },
  ecosystem: {
    communitySize: 'GitHub stars, npm downloads',
    documentation: 'completeness score',
    tooling: 'IDE support, DevTools'
  }
};

// Benchmark against current solution
function comparePerformance(currentSolution, newSolution) {
  // Implementation comparison
  // Metrics collection
  // Analysis and reporting
}
```
